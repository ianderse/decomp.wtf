"""The permuter, in the background: the decomp community's way through the last few percent.

A function at 95% usually differs in register allocation or instruction order, which comes down to how the C
is written, not what it does: the order of statements and declarations, a temporary, a cast, `x += 1` for
`x++`, `register`. decomp-permuter tries thousands of such rewrites and keeps what scores better; agents doing
it by hand spend turns (and tokens) on it, and stall. Here it runs on its own, on spare CPU, on the near misses
agents left (or autopilot's drafts reached): it holds a function for a minute at a time, so an agent that
wants it gets it next, records every improvement as the function's best attempt (agents start from it), and
a match as a match. Rewrites keep the meaning of the code (see permuter.py); what matches is still judged
byte for byte, like everything else.
